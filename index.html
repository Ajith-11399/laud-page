                            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Imam, and Ashiamma, a housewife. 
                            Kalam had four brothers and a sister, all elder to him. Kalam studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired 
                            a degree in Physics from Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the Madras Institute of 
                            Technology to pursue aerospace engineering. His dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed 
                            the qualifier by a narrow margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions were available with the IAF. After 
                            that, he got a job as a scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and 
                            Development Organisation (DRDO). He also worked under eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai. When R Venkataraman 
                            was the Defence Minister, Kalam was appointed the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development 
                            Programme that was a project aimed at developing a fleet of missiles. He was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ 
                            for his work in the development of ballistic missile technology. From 1992 to 1999, Kalam was the Chief Scientific 
                            Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO. Kalam was the Chief Project Coordinator during the 
                            Pokhran II tests. During this time, Kalam became India’s best-known scientist.

                        <p class="text-left">
                            In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had won by a huge margin. He was the first 
                            scientist to become India’s President and incidentally the first bachelor too. Kalam’s term as the president 
                            which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial for the office of the president itself. He came to be 
                            called the People’s President. His popularity soared among the people, especially school children. He visited 
                            many parts of the country and his speeches became popular for their motivational content. Despite pressure from 
                            the people to have him stand for a second term, he decided not to contest. After the presidency, Kalam became a 
                            visiting professor at the IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Shillong, IIM Indore, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 
                            Anna University, etc. Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 
                            2015. There was widespread grief expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a 7-day 
                            state mourning. The governments of various other countries as well as the United Nations expressed their grief.
                             He was laid to rest with full state honours at his native Rameswaram. Abdul Kalam was a man of integrity who was 
                             known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth after his death barring a few personal possessions which included 
                             his books, laptop, etc. He was knowledgeable in the teachings of various religions and had become a symbol of 
                             inter-faith dialogue.
